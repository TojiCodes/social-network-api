# Social Network API

This application is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. The API was built using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. 

## Description

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. This application has the foundation of a full-stack application, and is a demonstration of understanding the crucial element of data. No seed data is provided, so you’ll need to create your own data using Insomnia or other API testing tools after you’ve created your API.
